# [ReadySalted WordPress]

Really simple WordPress theme using the ReadySalted Boilerplate (derived from the popular HTML5 Boilerplate), ReadySalted is a minimal starting part for more experienced developers who want a quick responsive HTMl5 WordPress theme to build on. It doesn't suggest anything in terms of coding or visual style and has minimal WordPress functionality. It assumes a knowledge of WordPress theme development and doesn't try to teach you anything (or provide any in-depth examples).
